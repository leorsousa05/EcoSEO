# Code Organization

## No Business Logic in Views
- Keep business logic out of views/templates
- Use helpers, services, or configuration files for complex logic
- Views should only handle presentation and data binding
- Move calculations, API calls, and data processing to appropriate service classes
- Always if asked to create a page, separate it into sections inside @components/sections

## Code Quality

### Avoid Dead Code
- Remove unused or unnecessary code before committing
- Don't leave commented-out code in production
- Remove unused imports, variables, and functions
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable
