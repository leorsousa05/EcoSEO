# Project Conventions

## CSS and Styling
- Use CSS-defined utility classes from `@/src/assets/css/style.css` (e.g. `text-success`, `bg-success-light`) for semantic colors instead of raw Tailwind classes like `text-green-600`

## Components
- Always use the components inside `@/src/components/common` whenever needed.
- Prefer reusable components over custom implementations.
- Always read the README on components at your first requests to see what you can use.

## Configuration
- Always use the files located in `@/src/config/` within the code
- Scan these files to identify variables and incorporate them when making code changes
- Javascript put only on @assets/js/main.js

## Code Style
- Do not include comments in the code

## Examples

### ✅ Good CSS Usage
```html
<button class="text-success bg-success-light hover:bg-success">
    Success Button
</button>
```

### ✅ Good Component Usage
```php
<?= $this->insert('components/common/button', [
    'text' => 'Submit',
    'variant' => 'primary',
]) ?>
```

### ✅ Good Configuration Usage
```php
$siteConfig = require __DIR__ . '/../config/site.php';
$email = $siteConfig['email']['primary'];
```

### ❌ Bad
```html
<button class="text-green-600 bg-green-100">
    Success Button
</button>
```
