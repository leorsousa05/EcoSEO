# EcoSEO Development Rules

This is the main rules file that organizes all development guidelines for the EcoSEO project.

## Organization

The rules are organized into separate files for better maintainability:

- **project-conventions.mdc** - CSS, components, configuration and code style
- **code-organization.mdc** - Business logic separation and code quality
- **git-version-control.mdc** - Git workflows and semantic commits
- **accessibility.mdc** - Accessibility guidelines and inclusive design
- **responsive-design.mdc** - Mobile-first approach and responsive components
- **development-checklist.mdc** - Quality assurance checklist

## Quick Reference

### Core Principles
1. Use semantic CSS utility classes from `style.css`
2. Prefer reusable components from `@/src/components/common`
3. Keep business logic out of views
4. Follow mobile-first responsive design
5. Ensure accessibility in all components
6. Use semantic commit messages

### File Structure
- Views: `@/src/views/` - Only presentation logic
- Components: `@/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- Sections: `@/src/components/sections/` - Page sections
- Config: `@/src/config/` - Configuration files
- Assets: `@/src/assets/` - CSS and JavaScript

For detailed guidelines, refer to the specific rule files listed above.
