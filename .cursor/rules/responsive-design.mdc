# Responsive Design

## Mobile-First Approach
- Design for mobile devices first, then enhance for larger screens
- Use responsive breakpoints consistently across components
- Test all components at different screen sizes before committing
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px for mobile devices

## Responsive Components
- All components and sections must be responsive
- Use utility classes and breakpoints defined in the project
- Avoid fixed widths that could break on smaller screens
- Test navigation and menus on mobile devices
